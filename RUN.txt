Do on your favorite Linux desktop!
If you'd like a VM with the software contact Joseph 
<joseph@josephlewis.net>. Note that the VM is kind of large (~905mb)
It should go live at http://josephlewis.net/CriticalThieving.ova in 
a few hours, assuming the upload doesn't stall.

Checkout the source:

	svn co https://svn.cs.du.edu/courses/comp3703/s2013/group3/Project

Change to the Linux project directory

	cd Project/proj.linux/

If you are using an x86-64 platform, you should be able to just run the
shell script:

	./run.sh
	
and the game will start.

Otherwise build cocos2d:

	cd cocos2d-2.0-x-2.0.4
	
	./make-all-linux-project.sh
	cd ..
	make


Then run.
